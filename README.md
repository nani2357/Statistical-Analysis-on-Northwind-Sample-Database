# Statistical-Analysis-on-Northwind-Sample Database


## Overview
This repository contains a series of statistical tests performed on the Northwind sample database. The Northwind database is a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft for the purpose of learning and practicing SQL, data analysis, and data science techniques. This project aims to apply various statistical tests to draw insights from the data.

## Objectives
- To apply statistical tests like t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, and regression analysis on the Northwind dataset.
- To practice data cleaning and preprocessing.
- To visualize the results using graphs and plots.
- To interpret the results and make business recommendations.

## Tools Used
- SQL for data extraction
- Python for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for documentation

## Data
The Northwind database contains various tables including Customers, Orders, Products, Employees, and many more. The dataset is rich with categorical and numerical features, making it a good candidate for statistical analysis.

## Structure
- `SQL_Queries/`: Folder containing SQL queries used for data extraction.
- `Data/`: Folder containing the extracted data in CSV format.
- `Notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the statistical tests and visualizations.
- `Results/`: Folder containing the results of the statistical tests.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the SQL queries to extract the data.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks and run the cells to perform the statistical tests.
